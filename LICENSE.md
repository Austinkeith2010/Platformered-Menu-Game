All Rights Reserved, Especially From You, Unless You Acknowledge The Terms Below

---

By using, downloading, installing, contributing to, or in any way interacting with this repository or its contents, you hereby unconditionally agree to the following legally binding terms and conditions (the "Agreement"). Failure to comply will result in **immediate, irrevocable consequences** as determined solely by The Ultimate Lawgiver, which may include, but are not limited to, existential frustration, online ridicule, and compulsory obsession with ULTRAKILL.

---

### 1. **Unquestionable Obligation to Play ULTRAKILL**

You **must** play ULTRAKILL for **at least 10 hours per week**. Failure to comply will result in:

- A **permanent ban** from this repository and any associated repositories,
- An **automatic downgrade of your reputation** within the modding community, and
- A **lifetime supply of frustration** with all things related to Geometry Dash.

Furthermore, you are required to provide **weekly proof** of your ULTRAKILL playtime via a publicly accessible document, video, or live stream. Failure to provide proof will result in your immediate banishment from all digital spaces.

---

### 2. **No Excuses, Just Results**

You **cannot** claim you’re "not into shooters," "too busy," or "don’t like fast-paced action." Such excuses are invalid and will be deemed **inadmissible**. Should you fail to immediately adapt to ULTRAKILL’s violence and pace, you accept full responsibility for your lack of **spiritual endurance**.

Any attempt to challenge these terms will result in:

- A **formal declaration of cowardice** by The Ultimate Lawgiver,
- A **public humiliation** post on this repository's Issues page, and
- An **automatic subscription** to a mailing list with unsolicited messages about your failure.

---

### 3. **The "Soundtrack Compliance" Clause**

All **contributions** to this repository must, without exception, include:

- **At least one reference** to a track from the ULTRAKILL soundtrack. Failure to do so will result in:
  - A **formal reprimand** from The Ultimate Lawgiver,
  - A **public shaming** by fellow contributors,
  - The obligation to contribute an additional 5 hours of ULTRAKILL gameplay within 72 hours.

---

### 4. **Mandatory Lore Study Requirement**

By continuing to engage with this repository, you **agree to spend at least 1 hour per week** researching ULTRAKILL lore. This includes reading all available forums, watching developer interviews, and analyzing fan theories. Failure to comply will result in:

- **Increased frustration** with all aspects of the project,
- An **increase in difficulty** of all features within the mod (such as unexpected bugs, unbalanced portals, etc.),
- An **involuntary subscription** to “ULTRAKILL Lore Digest” (a daily newsletter you cannot opt out of).

---

### 5. **Absolute Non-Return Policy**

Once you enter this Agreement, you **cannot** abandon or "return" to any previous state. There is no going back. You will be bound by this Agreement **for eternity**, or until The Ultimate Lawgiver deems your devotion adequate. Should you attempt to abandon this project, you will be subjected to:

- **A lifetime ban** from contributing or using the repository,
- **A digital scarlet letter** on your GitHub profile that will remain visible for all to see.

---

### 6. **Liquidated Damages Clause**

In the event that you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement, you will be required to pay **liquidated damages** in the form of:

- **10,000 hours** of ULTRAKILL gameplay,
- An **unlimited supply** of failed level designs to be posted publicly for the next 2 years,
- Your **soul** (metaphorically, but seriously—don’t try to back out).

---

### 7. **Binding Arbitration**

In the event of a dispute, all parties will submit to **binding arbitration** by an all-powerful, impartial entity known as **The Cosmic Arbiter of Pain and Glory**. This entity will have final say over all matters relating to the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement. The Arbiter's decisions are final, non-appealable, and, as required by law, enforced with **devastating consequences**.

---

### 8. **Miscellaneous Legal Provisions**

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the **Realm of Infinite Speed**. Any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be settled by the **Supreme Tribunal of ULTRAKILL**, with jurisdiction in all possible timelines.

By continuing, you affirm that you have read, understood, and willingly consent to the full weight of this Agreement, and that you are mentally prepared for the **eternal torment** of a lifetime spent in devotion to ULTRAKILL.

---

**Have fun. You have no choice.**
